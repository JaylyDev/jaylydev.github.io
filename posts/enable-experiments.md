## Toggle Experiments on the Web

Due to the release of Chase the Clouds Update v1.21.90.1, the experiments section is not available to be edited through a resource pack in the new UI for Create and Edit World.

Instead, you can enable and disable experiments for a world using the new Minecraft Bedrock Experiments Editor. To get started, visit the [Minecraft Bedrock Experiments Editor](/bedrock-experiments/) page.

You can toggle which features you want enabled once you have uploaded your world (in `.mcworld` file format) to the editor. You can find the world from your OneDrive folder. After you have selected the features you want enabled, click on the **Download Modified World** button to download the world with the selected experiments enabled.

### Start from Template

If you want to enable experiments on a new world, no worries! You can use the [Start from Template](/bedrock-experiments/start-from-template/) page to choose a world template including flat worlds, to start enabling experiments.
