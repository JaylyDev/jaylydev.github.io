# Minecraft Statistics

![stats_promo_art](/assets/posts/statistics/thumbnail.png)

The Minecraft Statistics Add-On allows players to track certain tasks in the form of numerical data in a Minecraft Bedrock world. This is similar to the Statistics in-game feature presented in Java Edition.

## Statistics Screen

Currently, a player's statistics can be seen through the following function command:

```
/function statistics
```

or the statistics book given when you join the world for the first time. By which a tag (`stats_book_given`) will be assigned as they have been given the book.

![main screen](/assets/posts/statistics/main-screen-v1.2.0.png)

Similar to the Java Edition statistics' screen, this add-on divides statistics into three sections:

- **General** - The General screen displays a multitude of generic statistics that are listed in the form.
- **Items** - The Items screen displays the number of times different items and blocks have been broken, crafted, used to destroy blocks, picked up and dropped.
- **Mobs** - The Mob screen shows for each different type of mobs or other living entities (players, armor stands) how many the player has killed, or the number of deaths caused by those mobs.
- **Settings** - Change preference when viewing statistics.

## Item Statistics

![item statistics screen](/assets/posts/statistics/item-statistics.png)

Item statistics are viewed by each item type. The following statistic types are recorded:

| Statistic Type | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Block Mined    | Statistics related to the number of a particiuar block type a player has mined.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Item Broken    | Statistics related to the number of times when a player cause an item's durability to go to negative. Players' statistic increases when `playerBreakBlock` API event fires and the item before breaking a block has durability of zero. |
| Item Used      | Statistics related to the number of block or item used. Players' statistic increases when a player uses a block or item, this includes when the block or item triggers a block interaction (via `itemUseOn` API event).                 |
| Item Picked Up | Statistics related to the number of dropped items a player picked up. Players' statistic increases when the player picks up a dropped item of the specified type.                                                                       |
| Item Dropped   | Statistics related to the number of items that droped. Players' statistic increases when a player drops an item of the specified type from inventory.                                                                                   |

> [!NOTE]  
> The add-on also records item statistics for custom items, but translation for custom items may not be displayed properly in the items selection form.

## Mob Statistics

![mobs statistics screen](/assets/posts/statistics/mobs-statistics.png)

For mob statistics, they are divided into statistics for each entity type. This add-on records the following mob statistics:

| Statistic Type                            | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of entities killed                 | Statistics related to the number of entities a player killed. Players' statistic increases when a player kills an entity of the specified type.                  |
