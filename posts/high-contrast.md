# High Contrast Resource Pack (Bedrock)

![High Contrast Resource Pack](/assets/posts/high-contrast/thumbnail.png)

This is a resource pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition that enchance the contrast of UI elements, which it's high contrast theme is based off Minecraft Java's built-in high contrast resource pack.

The pack changes the user interface, such as textures of buttons and colors of text in menus like the settings screen to a high contrast look, which helps making elements in the menu UI easier to see, reduce eye strain, improve text readability, and accommodate user preferences to the screen contrast.

Similar to the Java's built-in high contrast resource pack, this pack also only affects the menu UIs for now, meaning the gameplay UI elements are not changed.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This resource pack does not support any screens that are rendered with the new Minecraft UI engine. This includes but not limited to:
>
> - The Play screen
> - The Edit / Create New World screen
> - The Achievement screen
