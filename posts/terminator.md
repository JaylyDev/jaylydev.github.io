### Still stuck at spawning a terminator?

Don't worry. When you spawn into the world with the Add-On loaded for the first time, a Terminator guide book will appear in your inventory.

![guide book](/assets/posts/terminator/guide-book.png)

Right click and scroll down to the bottom, a button that says "Spawn Terminator" will redirect you to this form:

![Spawn Terminator form 1](/assets/posts/terminator/spawn-terminator-form-1.png)

![Spawn Terminator form 2](/assets/posts/terminator/spawn-terminator-form-2.png)

By pressing the 'Submit' button, the game will spawn a terminator with changes applied based on options available in the 'Spawn Terminator' form.

## Function commands

The terminator add-on also provides ways to activate advanced features via `/function` commands.

- `/function terminator` - This shows the 'Spawn Terminator' form.

- `/function terminator/killall` - This kills every terminator and disables all currently running respawn events in existence, terminators will not respawn by running this command.

## Experimental Features

> [!CAUTION]
> The following features are being experimented. It may change or it may be removed in future releases.

### Traveling Through Overworld and Nether

Terminator is now able to travel between the overworld and the nether dimension. The following video demostrates this feature:

<iframe width="914" height="514" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tcm816bN5II" title="" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This event triggers when the terminator is in a dimension where there are zero players with survival or adventure gamemode. The terminator will attempt to build a nether portal to go to the other dimension attempts to find players to kill.
