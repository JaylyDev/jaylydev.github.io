# File Writing Demonstration

This file demonstrates the ability to write files into a git branch.

## Details

- **Created on**: August 16, 2025
- **Branch**: copilot/fix-61cdee4f-32aa-4e66-b5f1-03cb6ed257bc
- **Repository**: JaylyDev/jaylydev.github.io
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate file writing capability

## File Writing Examples in this Repository

This repository already contains several examples of file writing operations:

1. **Sitemap Generation** (`scripts/sitemap.mjs`):
   - Reads markdown files from the `posts` directory
   - Generates a sitemap.xml file
   - Writes the sitemap to `public/api/sitemap.xml`

2. **File Upload Processing** (`src/app/bedrock-experiments/page.tsx`):
   - Handles .mcworld file uploads
   - Processes NBT data using JSZip
   - Creates modified files for download

3. **Build Scripts** (`package.json`):
   - Runs scripts that generate files during the build process
   - Uses various Node.js file system operations

## Verification

This file itself serves as proof that files can be written to branches in this repository. The file was created programmatically and committed to the current branch.

## Conclusion

âœ… **Yes, files can be written into branches in this repository.**

The repository supports:
- Creating new files
- Modifying existing files  
- Programmatic file generation
- Git operations for committing changes
